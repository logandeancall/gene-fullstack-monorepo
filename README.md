# fullstack-monorepo

This is a monorepo containing 3 parts: `ui`, `frontend` and `api`

`ui` is the component library, `frontend` is the web app built in Next.js and `api` is the backend built in Nest.js

To start developing, simply make the following commands at the root:

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

After that, `frontend` can be accessed at `http://localhost:3001`, the storybook for `ui` at `http://localhost:6006` and the backend `api` at `http://localhost:8080`

The original aesthetics can be seen here:
